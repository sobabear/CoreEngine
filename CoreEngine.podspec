  # CoreKit

  Core is a framework for making more reactive applications inspired by [ReactorKit](https://github.com/ReactorKit/ReactorKit), [Redux](http://redux.js.org/docs/basics/index.html) with Combine. It's a very light weigthed and simple architecture, so you can either use CocoaPods or SPM to stay up to date, or just drag and drop into your project and go. Or you can look through it and roll your own.
  
  ## Example

  ```swift
  // on ViewController
   let label = UILabel()
   let increaseButton = UIButton()
   let decreaseButton = UIButton()
   var core: MainCore = .init()
   
   func increaseButtonTapped() {
     self.core.action(.increase)
   }
   
   func decreaseButtonTapped() {
     self.core.action(.decrease)
   }
   
   func bind() {
     core.$state.map(\.count)
         .sink { [weak self] count in
             self?.label.text = "\(count)"
         }
         .store(in: &subscription)
   }
   ...
   ```
   
   ```swift
   class MainCore: Core {
       var action: Action? = nil
       
       var subscription: Set<AnyCancellable> = .init()
       
       enum Action: Equatable, Hashable {
           case increase
